(defn cata
  "A catamorphic transducing context.

  Each node in the tree has it's children processed by xform in depth-first
  order.

  xfmap takes xform and a node and rebuilds the nodes' children by passing
  them through xform, e.g. (update node ::children #(into [] xform %)).

  Returns a possibly empty sequence of results (the root node could have
  been filtered or duplicated by xform).
